# OAS Eligibility: Proof of Residency Guide

## What Matters for Proving Your Eligibility

When applying for Old Age Security (OAS), Service Canada assesses your residency based on the totality of your connections to Canada. Here's what matters most:

### Primary Evidence (Strongest Proof)

| Evidence Type | Why It Matters | Documentation Needed |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Canadian Tax Returns as Resident** | This is the single most important proof. Filing as a resident declares to the CRA that Canada is your primary home. | Notices of Assessment (NOA) for all relevant years |
| **Provincial Health Insurance** | Maintaining coverage (OHIP, MSP, etc.) demonstrates you meet strict provincial residency requirements. | Health insurance cards, renewal documents |

### Secondary Evidence (Important Supporting Proof)

| Evidence Type | Why It Matters | Documentation Needed |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Property Ownership/Rental** | Shows concrete ties to a physical address in Canada. | Mortgage statements, lease agreements, property tax bills |
| **Bank Accounts** | Demonstrates maintained financial presence in Canada. | Bank statements showing active use |
| **Driver's License/ID** | Government-issued ID with Canadian address. | Valid provincial driver's license or photo ID card |
| **Utility Bills** | Regular household expenses at a Canadian address. | Electricity, water, gas, internet bills |
| **Insurance Policies** | Home, auto, or supplementary health insurance (e.g., Blue Cross). | Policy documents, payment records |

### For Periods Outside Canada

| Evidence Type | Why It Matters | Documentation Needed |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Return Travel Tickets** | Proof that absences were temporary with planned returns. | Flight itineraries, boarding passes |
| **Maintained Canadian Ties** | Evidence you kept your life in Canada during absences. | Continued bill payments, property maintenance records |
| **Communication Records** | Shows ongoing connection to Canada. | Phone bills, correspondence |

## What Doesn't Count as Strong Evidence

- Travel insurance policies (may actually work against your residency claim)
- Short-term visitor records
- Tourist activities in Canada
- Non-resident tax filings

## How to Organize Your Documentation

1. **Create a chronological timeline** of your residences since age 18
2. **Group documents by year** and type of evidence
3. **Highlight periods outside Canada** and prepare explanations
4. **Focus on continuous coverage** (no gaps in insurance, tax filing, etc.)

## Important Considerations

- Service Canada looks at the **whole picture** of your residential ties
- **Quality** of evidence matters more than quantity
- **Consistency** across documents is crucial
- **Official government documents** (tax assessments, health cards) carry the most weight

## When You Need to Provide Proof

You'll need this documentation when:
- Submitting your OAS application (ISP-3000 form)
- Completing the Residence Questionnaire (ISP-3000A)
- Responding to follow-up requests from Service Canada
- Appealing a decision about your eligibility

# OAS Eligibility: Understanding the 10-Year Residency Requirement

## Is Physical Presence of 3650 Days Required?

The requirement for Old Age Security (OAS) is **3650 days of residency**, which is a legal concept that is closely related to, but not exactly the same as, physical presence.

## Key Distinction: Physical Presence vs. Legal Residency

### 1. Physical Presence (The "3650 Days" Baseline)
- The Old Age Security Act requires at least **10 years of residence in Canada after age 18**
- This is typically calculated as **3,650 days** of physical presence
- Service Canada verifies this against entry/exit records from Canada Border Services Agency (CBSA)

### 2. Legal Residency (The Nuanced Reality)
- "Resided" can include some periods where you were **not physically in Canada**
- This applies if you maintained **strong residential ties** to Canada during absences
- Short absences (vacations, business trips) are automatically "forgiven" and don't interrupt residency

## How Residential Ties Are Assessed

Service Canada looks for evidence of maintained connections to Canada during any extended absences:

### Primary Evidence of Residential Ties
- ✅ Filing Canadian income taxes as a resident
- ✅ Maintaining a home in Canada (owning or renting)
- ✅ Keeping provincial health insurance active
- ✅ Having family (spouse/partner/dependents) in Canada

### Secondary Supporting Evidence
- ✅ Maintaining Canadian bank accounts
- ✅ Keeping a Canadian driver's license
- ✅ Retaining other possessions in Canada

## Scenarios and Implications

| Situation | Impact on Residency Clock | Action Required |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Continuous residence in Canada** | No issue | Clock runs continuously |
| **Short trips abroad (weeks/few months)** | No interruption | No action needed |
| **Extended absence (6+ months) with strong ties** | May still count | Prepare to prove residential ties |
| **Extended absence with severed ties** | Clock pauses | Period won't count toward 3650 days |

## Practical Application Example

**For someone who became PR on July 7, 2017:**

- **Base eligibility date:** July 7, 2027 (10 years later)
- **If they took multiple short vacations:** Still eligible July 7, 2027
- **If they spent 8 months abroad in 2020:** Must prove maintained residential ties during this period
- **If they cannot prove ties for 2020 absence:** Eligibility delayed by ~8 months

## Documentation to Prepare

For anyone with extended absences, gather these documents:
- Canadian tax returns (Notices of Assessment)
- Property deeds/lease agreements
- Provincial health insurance records
- Bank statements showing active Canadian accounts
- Utility bills for Canadian residence

## Recommendation

1. **Apply 11 months before** your target pension start date
2. **Service Canada will conduct a full review** of your history
3. **Be prepared to provide proof** of residential ties if any long absences are flagged
4. **When in doubt, keep records** of all connections to Canada during any time abroad
