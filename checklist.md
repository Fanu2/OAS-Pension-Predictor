# OAS Eligibility: Proof of Residency Guide

## What Matters for Proving Your Eligibility

When applying for Old Age Security (OAS), Service Canada assesses your residency based on the totality of your connections to Canada. Here's what matters most:

### Primary Evidence (Strongest Proof)

| Evidence Type | Why It Matters | Documentation Needed |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Canadian Tax Returns as Resident** | This is the single most important proof. Filing as a resident declares to the CRA that Canada is your primary home. | Notices of Assessment (NOA) for all relevant years |
| **Provincial Health Insurance** | Maintaining coverage (OHIP, MSP, etc.) demonstrates you meet strict provincial residency requirements. | Health insurance cards, renewal documents |

### Secondary Evidence (Important Supporting Proof)

| Evidence Type | Why It Matters | Documentation Needed |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Property Ownership/Rental** | Shows concrete ties to a physical address in Canada. | Mortgage statements, lease agreements, property tax bills |
| **Bank Accounts** | Demonstrates maintained financial presence in Canada. | Bank statements showing active use |
| **Driver's License/ID** | Government-issued ID with Canadian address. | Valid provincial driver's license or photo ID card |
| **Utility Bills** | Regular household expenses at a Canadian address. | Electricity, water, gas, internet bills |
| **Insurance Policies** | Home, auto, or supplementary health insurance (e.g., Blue Cross). | Policy documents, payment records |

### For Periods Outside Canada

| Evidence Type | Why It Matters | Documentation Needed |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Return Travel Tickets** | Proof that absences were temporary with planned returns. | Flight itineraries, boarding passes |
| **Maintained Canadian Ties** | Evidence you kept your life in Canada during absences. | Continued bill payments, property maintenance records |
| **Communication Records** | Shows ongoing connection to Canada. | Phone bills, correspondence |

## What Doesn't Count as Strong Evidence

- Travel insurance policies (may actually work against your residency claim)
- Short-term visitor records
- Tourist activities in Canada
- Non-resident tax filings

## How to Organize Your Documentation

1. **Create a chronological timeline** of your residences since age 18
2. **Group documents by year** and type of evidence
3. **Highlight periods outside Canada** and prepare explanations
4. **Focus on continuous coverage** (no gaps in insurance, tax filing, etc.)

## Important Considerations

- Service Canada looks at the **whole picture** of your residential ties
- **Quality** of evidence matters more than quantity
- **Consistency** across documents is crucial
- **Official government documents** (tax assessments, health cards) carry the most weight

## When You Need to Provide Proof

You'll need this documentation when:
- Submitting your OAS application (ISP-3000 form)
- Completing the Residence Questionnaire (ISP-3000A)
- Responding to follow-up requests from Service Canada
- Appealing a decision about your eligibility
